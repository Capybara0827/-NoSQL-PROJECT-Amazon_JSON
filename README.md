✨ Case Background

1. Amazone has decided to expand its operations by delivering fresh groceries.
2. Amazone has decided to experiment with same-day and instant grocery delivery using Manchester. 
3. Six Morrizon grocery stores have been chosen for instant pick-up and delivery by delivery drivers who are Amazone partners. 


🔍 Problem Analysis
1. Modify the existing ER diagram according to new business and data requirements.
2. Design a NoSQL schema for Amazone following Collection Relationship.
3. Based on schema, use MongoDB Compass or MongoDB Shell to implement a demonstration database.


🧐 Rationale behind Design
1. ER Diagram and NoSQL Schema
（1）Try to embed as much as we can to reduce the time it takes to fetch the data where appropriate based on queries.
（2）Add Indexes to speed up the performance for crucial queries.
（3）Focus on the actual queries instead of avoiding data duplication.

2. Demonstration Database
（1）Implement mock data resembling actual use-case.
（2）Implement key queries for the Front-End based on requirements given.
（3）Introduce Python scripts as means of merging data pipelines together and visualization.
